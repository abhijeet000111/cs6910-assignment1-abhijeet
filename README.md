# Fashion MNIST Classification with Neural Networks

This project implements a neural network for classifying Fashion MNIST dataset using various activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers. The project includes data preprocessing, model implementation, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Overview

This project consists of the following components:

1. **Importing Libraries and Downloading Data**: Importing necessary libraries and downloading the Fashion MNIST dataset using Keras.

2. **Dataset Preprocessing**: Preprocessing the dataset by reshaping, normalizing, and splitting it into training, validation, and test sets.

3. **Components of the Neural Network Model**: Defining activation functions, loss functions, and initializing parameters.

4. **Forward Propagation**: Implementing forward propagation through the neural network.

5. **Backpropagation**: Implementing backpropagation to calculate gradients.

6. **Optimizers**: Implementing various optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), momentum, RMSprop, and Adam.

7. **Training the Neural Network**: Training the neural network using different configurations of activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers.

8. **Prediction and Evaluation**: Making predictions and evaluating the model's performance on the test set.
